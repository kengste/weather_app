You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

This is a pure frontend application. To avoid running into CORS issues, it is recommended the application to be run on Chrome browsers with Allow-Control-Allow-Origin:* Chrome extension. A forward proxy would have probably resolved the CORS issue but a forward proxy with open access would have been shut down in a matter of days in any case due to security issues.
